# ::set-output migrator

## Abstract

Change all workflows using `::set-output` to write to $GITHUB_OUTPUT environment files.

## Why?

I'm lazy. Microsoft will deprecate it's usage in an undefined time as stated [here](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-10-11-github-actions-deprecating-save-state-and-set-output-commands/)
